- 👋 Hi, I’m Uchenna Gerald Umeh
- 👀 I’m interested in .net programming using C#, Vb.net, MSSQL, Javascript, SOAP, REST, Devops for building and deploying Web apps, Desktop apps, SQL server jobs, windows services, web services. I have also tried PostgreSQL (migration of MSSQL DB to open source PostgrSQL to save costs). I have worked on a couple of small, medium, and huge projects, and these have seen me implement front-end dev, back-end dev, SQL scripting, building and consuming webservices and APIs. I also involved in software assurance: functional and non functional tests of applications to ensure scope of software development is fully fulfilled.
